# SDLx - An SDL2/3 wrapper for PureBasic

⚠️ Work in progress! Total rewrite started September 2024. ⚠️

This is a single-file wrapper/helper library for easily using [libSDL](http://libsdl.org) API within [PureBasic](http://purebasic.com).

The goal is not to wrap 100% of the SDL API, but a reasonable subset which is relevant to PureBasic and its supported platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac, Raspi).

For now, `SDL2.pbi` is the main file of interest, based on the latest version of SDL2.

As SDL3 is officially released, focus will switch over to `SDL3.pbi`.
